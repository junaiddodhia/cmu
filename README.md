# **Overview**

The Carnegie Mellon University Housing Check-In System was developed to digitize the housing check-in process for over 1,000 students annually. The project addressed inefficiencies in the paper-based workflow, reducing processing time by 50% and significantly improving user satisfaction. The system was designed, developed, and deployed with validation and oversight from the Director of Student Affairs at CMU.

# **Problem Statement**

The housing check-in process previously relied on paper forms, resulting in:

1. **Long Wait Times**: Students often queued for hours.
2. **Frequent Errors**: Manual data entry caused inconsistencies in records.
3. **Lack of Real-Time Updates**: Staff could not monitor or manage check-ins effectively.

The digitization effort aimed to address these issues, improving the overall experience for students and staff.
